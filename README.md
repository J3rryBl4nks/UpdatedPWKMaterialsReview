Review of the Updated PWK Materials

### This won't be an exhaustive review of the matierals, but an overview of what I found to be significant changes ###

I purchased the update to the OSCP Course materials and Videos, I will be reviewing the updates from a high level (not posting any
information that would be considered a breach of the NDA).


First big change I noticed:

### No More Open VAS ###
This is a HUGE step forward. Using Nessus instead of Open VAS is fantastic.

### Privesc Materials Section ###
The refresh here was much needed, and the materials are better, but still incomplete. I really liked the methodology and I get that you can't print an entire treatise on Privesc, but the scripts used are hilariously outdated.

### Password Cracking ###
The password cracking materials teach the wrong approach with the wrong tools in my opinion.

### Active Directory ###
The AD material is very good.

### Powershell Empire ###
Using the old Empire, but the foundations and ideas are great!

### Putting it together exercise ###
A fascinating exercise with great takeways.

# Recommendations #
For current OSCP students, this update is fantastic. For those who already have their OSCP I would pass on getting the new materials unless you want to pay that money for a consolidated AD overview. You can get the AD materials elsewhere for free.
